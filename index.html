              <h3> Penetration Testing: NYU with HarvardX</h3>
              <p>
                This is a self-paced optional project that provides an undergraduate-level introduction to information security and privacy, network security & penetration testing.  The material in the program will help prepare students for careers and further project work in cybersecurity, computer science and information technology.
                The project covers the phases of the penetration testing life cycle:
                <br>
                - Perform reconnaissance - Scan/enumerate - Gain access - Maintain Access - Report

              <h3>Ising Model: NNSA </h3>
              <p>The wide-ranging applicability of the Ising model have made it a valuable tool to gauge the performance for emerging computer hardware. Herein, we implement and benchmark the two-dimensional Ising model on a Cerebras Wafer Scale-engine (WSE) – a revolutionary processor that is opening a new frontier for computing. We show that the performance of the Ising model on the WSE outperforms the best-published benchmarks by XXX orders of magnitude.  The findings showcase the power and potential of the WSE in materials modeling.

              <h3>Molecular Dynamics: NNSA
              </h3>
              <p>
                On a Cerebras Wafer Scale-engine (WSE) hardware, we present three parallel algorithnls which are appropriate for a general class of MD problems
                that has two salient characteristics. Tile first characteristic is that forces are limited in range, meaning each
                atom interacts only with other atoms that are geometrically nearby. Solids and liquids are often modeled
                this way due to electronic screening effects or simply to avoid the computational cost of including long-range
                Coulombic forces. For short-range MD tlm computational effort per timestep scales as N, the number of atoms.

                Wafer Scale Engine is an emerging technology for high-performance scientific computing beyond the traditional computing architectures, such as CPU and GPU. Some kernels
                have been developed this new hardware to solve partial differential equations for CFD simulations. By collaborating with material modeling experts
                and software developer experts for the specific WSE hardware, I am learning a lot of modeling in physics, python coding, assembly language, and the specific hardware and
                the advance architecture, which brings about one million processing elements (cores) into one waffle with about 1 feet * 1 feet.
